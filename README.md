## Website Description

StartUp Again is a website bringing entrepreneurs and products/ideas together.

### Purpose

We are creating a two sided marketplace for entrepreneurs called StartUp Again. This web app will help unsuccessful startups to on-sell their ideas - they may have had a great product, and out a lot of time, energy and resources into it, but were unable to get the business off the ground. Rather than take the full loss, the founder may be able to on-sell their product, gleaning back some of their outlay, while the buyer receives a product they feel is viable.

### Functionality / Features

We have 5 sprints of features:

1. Our most basic MVP
- Users may login and create a profile
- Users may create, edit, update and destroy their own listings
- Logins shall be authenticated

2. Everything from step 1 plus -
- Admin will be able to moderate the web app along with deleting any toxic messages or spam listings
- Private messaging for users to talk to each other

3. Everything from 1 and 2 plus -
- Users may create a watchlist of products they may be interested in
- Users can upload and swap NDAs and contracts

4. Everything from the first 3 plus -
- Users may tag their product by category eg financial, fashion, disabilities, tech etc
- Users may search for startup products/ideas by category 
- Users may bid on products

5. This is the ultimate idea. It is all 4 previous points plus -
- Sort by popularity
- Being able to list you product as either an auction or buy it now
- Thread comments on a product

### Target Audience

Our target audience fall into two main groups of people:

- Those who have attempted a StartUp and it has not been successful - they may have put a lot of time, resources and energy into the idea but unable to get the business off the ground. Here they can recoup their costs and see their idea come to fruition.
- Those who would like to start a business and may not have a viable idea to run with, or just enjoy the challenge of bringing an idea to life - entrepreneurs may have seen a product they really like and can see a future for it. They may have the right connections or capital to make it happen. This is a platform for entrepreneurs to grab a great product and make it their own.

### Tech Stack
